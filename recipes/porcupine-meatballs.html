    <h1>Porcupine Meatballs</h1>

    <p>Porcupine Meatballs contain no actual porcupine or any other exotic game-their name hails from their spiky appearance. Unlike other meatballs, this recipe adds rice instead of breadcrumbs or another binding agent. When the ground beef-rice mixture cooks, the grains of rice absorb liquid and become plump and pronounced, sticking out of the meatballs like a porcupine's quills. </p>
    <p> Otherwise, they are a standard beef-yes, just beef-meatball recipe that gets cooked in a seasoned tomato sauce. Some Porcupine Meatball recipes call for simmering them in tomato soup, and that's certainly a shortcut option available to you, too. For many, the version cooked in tomato soup tastes like home, but our top-rated recipe for Porcupine Meatballs ditches the soup can for a homemade tomato sauce that tastes even better, and many reviewers agree. </p>
